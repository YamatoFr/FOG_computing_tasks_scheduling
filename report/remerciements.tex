First, I'm extremely grateful to the LAAS-CNRS for giving me the opportunity to work in their laboratory. I
would like to express my deepest appreciation to my tutors, Dr.~Tom Gu√©rout, researcher at the LAAS-CNRS,
and Andrei Doncescu, professor at the University of French West Indies, for their guidance and support
throughout this internship. I am grateful for their patience, encouragement, and invaluable advice.

Furthermore, I would like to thank my colleagues and office mates for making each day at the laboratory enjoyable.
Lastly, I would like to thank my mother for her unwavering support and encouragement throughout my studies.
