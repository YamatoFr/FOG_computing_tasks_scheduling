\chapter*{Introduction}

As the number of devices grows exponentially, the demand for computing resources increases. The traditional cloud
computing model is not sufficient to handle the massive amount of data generated by these devices. Fog computing is an
alternative model that extends the computing resources to the edge of the network, closer to the devices. This model
reduces the latency and bandwidth usage, and improves the overall performance of the system. However, the increasing
demand for computing resources also raises concerns about the energy consumption and the environmental impact of fog
computing systems.

In this paper, we will propose an AI-based task scheduling algorithm that integrate the use of green energy sources
while satisfying the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the users.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, we present an overview of the
existing research on task scheduling, energy efficiency and AI in the context of fog computing. In Chapter 3, we
describe the proposed task scheduling algorithm and the integration of green energy sources. In Chapter 4, we present
the experimental results and the performance evaluation of the algorithm. Finally, in Chapter 5, we conclude the paper
and discuss the future work.
