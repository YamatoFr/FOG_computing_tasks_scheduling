There are many existing studies and researches on the topics task scheduling, energy efficiency and AI in the context
of fog computing. The concept of fog computing was introduced by Cisco in 2012 \cite{bonomi_et_al_2012}, and since
then, many researches have been conducted to improve the performance of fog computing systems and reduce their
environmental impact.

\section*{Task Scheduling in Fog Computing}

The task scheduling problem in fog computing has been widely studied in the literature. Many researchers have proposed
different algorithms and techniques to optimize the task scheduling process in fog computing systems. For example,
\cite{canali_lancellotti_2019} proposed a task scheduling algorithm based on the genetic algorithm to optimize the energy.
